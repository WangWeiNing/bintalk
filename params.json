{"tagline":"A lightweight binary data \tinterchange format","body":"bintalk\r\n=======\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\n**bintalk** is a lightweight tool which is used to encode/decode structured data to/from binary. Bintalk use a source file which describes the structured data to generate encoding/decoding code of a specified language. Diverse languages can communicate each other freely based on the same set of data descriptions by using the generated code.\r\nUnlike other systems(JSON, XML, ProtocolBuffers...), bintalk is a very small and lightweight tool. The encoded binary data contains no meta data and is small enough to be transmited through network. For each supported language, there is a very efficient runtime library which simply encapsulate the binary operation of the language.\r\n**bintalk** is designed to support as many languages as it could. It's easy to integrate a new language into bintalk, as long as the language support binary operations.\r\n\r\nTopology\r\n--------\r\n###compiler\r\nBintalk compiler is used to generate code for a specified language from a btk source file.\r\n\r\n###runtime\r\nRuntime library for each supported language.\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n--------\r\nTools needed:\r\n* cmake\r\n* gnu flex & bison\r\n\r\n###Unix\r\n* make a \"build\" dir in your favorite position.\r\n* cd build\r\n* cmake BINTALK_SRC/compiler/src\r\n* make\r\n\r\n###Windows\r\nYou can use cmake-gui tool to generate visual studio solution files.\r\n* run cmake-gui tool\r\n* specify source code directory\r\n* specify build directory as \"BINTALK_SRC/compiler/src\"\r\n* Configure\r\n* Generate\r\n\r\nRunning\r\n-------\r\nbintalk [options] btkfile\r\n* -o dir directory for your generated code.\r\n* -i dirs directories which are use to search import files.\r\n* -g gen code generator name.\r\n\r\nSupported Language\r\n------------------\r\n* c++\r\n* c#\r\n* python\r\n* erlang\r\n\r\n","name":"Bintalk","note":"Don't delete this file!
